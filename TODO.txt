TO DO
=====

* Is README.Rmd used to generate README.md? It is confusing to have
  both in the same folder. Maybe move README.Rmd to a subfolder (e.g.,
  etc)?

* It is odd that you have an R folder and a Code folder. Maybe rename
  them? e.g., "process" and "analysis".

* Give target file list in Data after downloading all the files.
