TO DO
=====

* It is odd that you have an R folder and a Code folder. Maybe rename
  them? e.g., "process" and "analysis". I'm not sure what is the
  distinction between these two folders.

* Remove mouthwash_paper_sims.R?

* Update etc/README.Rmd to reflect changes to README.md.

* Add Makefile rule to clean up outputs.

* Specify targets for plots and remove .PHONY lines in Makefile.

* Clarify comment, "If on your own computer, use this."

* What are the files that are being downloaded in "Get data"? It would
  be helpful to know what these files are, and what they are for. Add
  a brief description of the files that are downloaded.

* Add dependencies to data files in Makefile.

* Create sbatch script for running on RCC cluster.
