# Source to reproduce results from Gerard & Stephens (2017)

This repository contains source code to reproduce the empirical
evaluations of [Gerard & Stephens (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10066).
The new methods can be found in the
[vicar](https://github.com/dcgerard/vicar) package.

If you find a bug, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/dcgerard/ruvb_sims/issues).

This code has been tested in ...

## Instructions

To reproduce the results of Gerard & Stephens (2017), you need to (1)
install the appropriate R packages, (2) obtain the appropriate data,
(3) run `make` and (4) get some coffee while you wait. Please read
below for details on each of these steps.

### Install software and R packages

1. Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org).

2. Install [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make).

3. Install the required R packages by running the following commands
in the R interactive environment. (Note the order of these commands is
important---the Bioconductor packages should be installed before the
CRAN packages.)

```R
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("sva","limma","qvalue"),suppressUpdates = TRUE)
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "stringr", "reshape2", "pROC",
                   "ruv", "cate", "devtools", "ashr", "bfa",
				   "xtable", "dplyr", "ggthemes", 
				   "assertthat", "R.utils"))
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/seqgendiff")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/vicar")
```

See below for the versions of the packages that I used for the paper.

### Get data

Download the following files from the
[GTEx Portal](https://www.gtexportal.org) and copy them to the
[Data](data) subdirectory. In order to replicate my results, it is
important to use version "6p" of the GTEx data. To access these files,
you will need to register for a GTEx Portal account if you have not
done so already.

1. `GTEx_Data_V6_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt`
2. `GTEx_Analysis_v6p_RNA-seq_RNA-SeQCv1.1.8_gene_reads.gct.gz`
3. `gencode.v19.genes.v6p_model.patched_contigs.gtf.gz`
4. `GTEx_Data_V6_Annotations_SubjectPhenotypesDS.txt`

Next, download the list of human housekeeping genes and the
NCBI-to-Ensembl gene mapping file, and copy these files to the
[Data](data) directory:

5. http://www.tau.ac.il/~elieis/HKG/HK_genes.txt
6. ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene2ensembl.gz

After completing these steps, the Data folder should look like this:

```bash
cd Data
ls -1
# GTEx_Analysis_v6p_RNA-seq_RNA-SeQCv1.1.8_gene_reads.gct.gz
# GTEx_Data_V6_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt
# GTEx_Data_V6_Annotations_SubjectPhenotypesDS.txt
# HK_genes.txt
# gencode.v19.genes.v6p_model.patched_contigs.gtf.gz
# gene2ensembl.gz
```

### Run make

To reproduce all of the results in Gerard and Stephens (2017), move to
the root directory in your local copy of this repository, and run
`make` from the terminal. This will run all the steps in the data
processing and analysis pipeline. Note that you may need to adjust
some of the settings in the [Makefile](Makefile) to suit your
computing environment.

Since some of the steps take a long time to run, you may not want to
run everything at once. If you want to reproduce just the results from
Section 5.1, run

``` bash
make sims
```

If you want to reproduce just the results from Section 5.2, run

``` bash
make gtex_analysis
```

If you want to reproduce the figure in the introduction, run

``` bash
make one_data
```

At any point during or after the commands are running, it may be
helpful to inspect the `.Rout` files saved in the [Output](Output)
subdirectory.

### Get Coffee

All of these runs (except the last one) should take a very long time
(a day to a couple of days). You should get some coffee. Here is a
list of some of my favorite places:

-   Chicago
    -   [Sawada Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sawada-coffee-chicago)
    -   [Plein Air Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/plein-air-cafe-and-eatery-chicago-2)
-   Seattle
    -   [Bauhaus Ballard](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bauhaus-ballard-seattle)
    -   [Cafe Solstice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-solstice-seattle)
-   Columbus
    -   [Yeah, Me Too](https://www.yelp.com/biz/yeah-me-too-columbus)
    -   [Stauf's Coffee Roasters](https://www.yelp.com/biz/staufs-coffee-roasters-columbus-2)
    -   [Caffe Apropos](https://www.yelp.com/biz/caff%C3%A9-apropos-columbus-2)

If you are having trouble reproducing these results, it might be that
you need to update some of your R packages. These are the versions
that I used (including some versions of packages that are not actually
needed to run the code):

```R
sessionInfo()
```
