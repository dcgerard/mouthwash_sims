To-do items, comments & suggestions for improving reproducibility

* TO DO (Peter): Create sbatch script for running on RCC cluster.

* TO DO: Update etc/README.Rmd to reflect changes to README.md.

* TO DO: In your code, clarify (or remove) comments, "If on your own
  computer, use this."

* TO DO: If it turns out that Rmosek is important for optimizing the
  adaptive shrinkage ("ash") models, add instructions for installing
  MOSEK, Rmosek and REBayes.

* TO DO: In README, briefly describe computing environment(s) where
  code has been tested. (The sessionInfo at the bottom is also useful.)

* TO DO: In the README under "Instructions", give a ballpark estimate
  of the amount of storage space needed to download the data files and
  generate the outputs. Likewise, it would also be helpful to know
  (roughly) how much memory is needed to run the analyses in R.

* TO DO: In Makefile, correctly define rules that generate multiple
  outputs with one command. For an example of how to do this
  correctly, see the rule for generating the CSV files in
  Output/gtex_tissue_gene_reads_v6p. To understand why this works, run
  "make --dry-run sims", then replace $(tissue_targets) in the rule by
  $(tissue_dat).

* SUGGESTION: it is odd that you have an R folder and a Code
  folder. Maybe rename them? e.g., "process" and "analysis". I'm not
  sure what is the distinction between these two folders.

* SUGGESTION: Add Makefile rule to clean up outputs.

* SUGGESTION: Add ./Data file dependencies to rules in Makefile.

* SUGGESTION: What are the files that are being downloaded in "Get
  data"? It would be helpful to know what these files are, and what
  they are for.

* SUGGESTION: Whenever possible, in a script it is best to load all
  the necessary packages upfront. It is frustrating to wait hours and
  then have to re-run a script because a package was not available, or
  failed to load! This is an easy error to catch at the very
  beginning.

* SUGGESTION: This is a general suggestion about the design of the
  analsyis pipeline. It would be better if there were more smaller
  targets in the Makefile. To illustrate, fit_mouthwash.R takes a long
  time to run, and at the end of the script it saves all the results
  to several .Rds files. It seems that it would be possible to design
  fit_mouthwash.R so that it takes one argument, the tissue, and runs
  the entire analysis on one tissue. Then the commands executed by
  calling "make gtex_analysis" would be

    R CMD BATCH fit_mouthwash.R adiposetissue
    R CMD BATCH fit_mouthwash.R bladder
    etc.

  There are many advantages to smaller chunks; one obvious advantage
  is that it is easier to debug errors, and it is less frustrating
  when errors occur.

* SUGGESTION: Add missing descriptions to steps in Makefile.

* SUGGESTION: Ideally, the Makefile should be in the same directory as
  the R scripts, or the scripts should be run so that the working
  directory is the same as the location of the scripts. Not strictly
  necessary, but avoids some confusion about file paths.

* SUGGESTION: Output progress and timing for long-running steps in R
  data processing and analysis scripts. This is important to provide
  assurance to user that things are working!

* SUGGESTION: Fix Makefile so that it correctly determines which
  dependencies are missing, and which rules to run. Right now, for
  example, "make sims" will always run R/plot_mouthwash_sims.R
  regardless of whether the plots have been previously generated.
